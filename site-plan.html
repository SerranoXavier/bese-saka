      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Exotic food is amazing.<br>But there are three reasons why people hesitate to go into an exotic store:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The store is often in an unfriendly area.</li>
        <li>The store is unorganized and has very poor customer service.</li>
        <li>The freshness of some of the products and the cleanliness of the store are doubtful.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>However, Bese Saka Store is very different:<br>It puts on a new level what an exotic store should look like!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It has an attractive look</li>
        <li>It has a friendly and clean environment</li>
        <li>It gives the customers the best experience possible with top-of-the-art client services</li>
        <li>It proposes well-chosen, fresh, labeled, and quality products</li>
      </ul>



      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The intended audience is double. First, the usual clients for such an exotic store (foreigners, immigrants, and people with a migrant background). But the will is also to bring occasionaly exotic food consumers and anybody who is curious about exotic food.</p>
      <p>We want to enhance exotic food perception to everyone. We want people to discover new fragrances and tastes. Our project is to bring to everyone the great and fabulous diversity of humanking cuisines in a simple and attractive way.</p>
